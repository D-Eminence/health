# Integration log

## 2026-10-04 — unified portal integration

- Audited the frontend against `hid-system` commit `c4b5445`. `Dashboard.zip`,
  `HID.html` and `hid-1.0` were used as visual/workflow references; backend
  routes and DTOs came from `hid-system`.
- Kept the public Next.js site separate from one Vite authenticated portal
  origin. Patient routes, `/provider/*` and `/admin/*` now mount under that
  portal. Public calls use the commercial pricing and demo endpoints; quote
  prices remain quotes.
- Connected supported patient, provider and platform screens to registered
  `/api/v1` browser requests, cookie sessions, CSRF and permission-aware UI.
  Provider coverage includes clinical records and versioned status changes,
  active Lab order creation, prescription handoff, Lab accession/specimen
  custody and execution/results, pharmacy, OCR and staff outreach.
- Added direct-route portal tests covering patient, provider and admin entry
  points. Local checks and builds are code-level verification; no deployed
  browser or staging acceptance is recorded.
- Confirmed with the user that no staging environment exists. Production needs
  same-origin `/api/v1` forwarding for host-only Strict cookies. A portal host
  outside the backend Turnstile allowlist needs a backend configuration change.
- Recorded patient consent and organization application backend defects,
  emergency detailed-chart restriction, non-persistent facility selection,
  Lab draft activation, direct-cross-origin CORS mismatches, provider
  configuration gates and missing reference workflow contracts in
  [open questions](./OPEN-QUESTIONS.md).

This log records implementation scope, not a release sign-off. The reference
[gap map](./HEALTH_ID_COMPLETE_FRONTEND_GAP_MAP.md) is a baseline audit rather
than a live completion tracker.
